### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a fun one to program because I actually felt like I was creating a program that I myself would enjoy. It was also just a great way to put together all of the skills I had learned along the way. I learned a lot about functions and conditional statements, and I got a fundamental understanding of how loops work. I’m also really proud of the way I programmed the HandScore() function, it was just so satisfying to see the code I wrote work perfectly.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was pretty fun, this was where I practiced the ins and outs of if statements. It was especially cool because the program I created was a Hi-Lo game, and while it is very simple, I’ve always wanted to code my own games, and this was a great introduction into doing just that.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 was a bit of a milestone for me, as it was the first time I utilized file I/O in one of my programs. From my understanding, file I/O plays a large role in almost all computer science projects, including in game development, so taking a crack at this concept was a pleasure. Honestly, this lab more than anything showed off the potential of what can be done with code.
